## Project 1: Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji
The first project in the repository is based on the art series **"Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji"** by the famous Japanese artist **Katsushika Hokusai**. This project consists of a web scraping script that extracts images and their descriptions into a csv file from a [table on the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-six_Views_of_Mount_Fuji).
