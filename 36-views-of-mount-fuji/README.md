### Project Description:
In this work, information was extracted from [Wikipedia - Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-six_Views_of_Mount_Fuji) into a CSV file and 36 images of the views were downloaded and stored locally.

The dataset and images extracted in this project were used in one of the **CS50P** shorts titled ["Reading and Writing CSVs - CS50P Shorts"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRbkyEFCqZo&t=1s).

### Libraries Used:
- **`requests`**: For making HTTP requests and obtaining page content.
- **`BeautifulSoup`**: For parsing HTML and extracting relevant data.
- **`os`**: For creating a directory to store the downloaded images if it does not already exist.
